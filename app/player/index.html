============================================================ IDENTITY
FOUNDATION (PROTECTED)
============================================================

• “Most reliable club in the bag.” • Reliability over flash. • No AI
score manipulation ever. • Player accountability is absolute. •
Scorekeeper is final authority.

============================================================ PLAYER
SCREEN – STRUCTURE (FINAL)
============================================================

TOP HEADER

• Player Name (single player only) • Hole number + Par • Mode badge
(Buddy / Serious) • Status badge: - Draft - Submitted - Edit Required -
Locked

SCORE STEPPER

• Large centered score display. • + and – buttons manually adjust hole
total. • This is the ONLY control that changes hole total. • Penalty
does NOT auto-adjust score.

STAT CAPSULES (8 IDENTICAL COMPONENTS)

All 8 capsules are visually identical in size, depth, frame, and
lighting.

TOP ROW: 1. Fairway 2. Sand 3. Green 4. Putts

BOTTOM ROW: 5. Penalty 6. Notes 7. AI Fairway 8. AI Green

RULE: Images NEVER change between states. Only overlays change (ball,
glow, number, flag color).

PUTTS LOGIC (LOCKED)

Tap cycle: 0 – White flag 1 – Gold flag 2 – Green flag 3 – Red flag 4–5
– Dark red Next tap resets to white.

PENALTY LOGIC (LOCKED)

• Tap = +1 penalty. • Red intensity increases first 1–3 taps. • After 3,
color stays strong red, number increments. • AI never adds strokes. • On
first tap (0→1), show toast: “Need the ruling? Yes / No” • If Yes →
advisory modal opens. • AI explains only. Player must manually adjust
score.

NOTES

• Private to player. • Not synced to main feed. • Not deleted by Reset
Hole.

AI RULES OFFICIAL (HARD LOCK)

• Advisory only. • Cannot add strokes. • Cannot remove strokes. • Cannot
modify totals. • Cannot modify penalties. • Cannot override anything. •
Ends advice with: “If that applies, use the Penalty button.”

BOTTOM CONTROL BAR

• Undo Last • Submit Hole • Reset Hole (long-press protected)

SUBMIT FLOW

• Submit = soft lock. • Player can re-edit until scorekeeper locks. • If
edited after submit → EDITED marker triggered.

DISCREPANCY SYSTEM

• Scorekeeper can flag Discrepancy. • Player sees “Edit Required.” •
Player edits and re-submits. • Any change logs edit history.

EDIT AUDIT (HOLE TOTAL ONLY)

Tracked: • Previous total • New total • Delta (+/-) • Edit count

Displayed on scorecard: 4 → 5 (+1)

RESET HOLE (FINAL DEFINITION)

• Clears current hole scoring inputs. • Clears submission flag. • Does
NOT delete notes. • Does NOT delete prior hole data.

VISUAL LOCK

• One master capsule component duplicated 8 times. • No alternate
capsule designs. • No visual drift. • No different lighting between
capsules. • Player screen uses accent color. • Scorekeeper screen uses
gold authority.

FUTURE (PARKED)

• Tournament / Volunteer Live Scoring Mode parked in Vault 7. • Not
active in Phase 1.
